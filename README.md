# E-commerce Store Design

This project is a simple re-creation of an e-commerce store design found on Dribbble, built using only HTML and SCSS (CSS). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of responsive web design and my ability to write clean, maintainable code. No JavaScript is included or planned for this project.
